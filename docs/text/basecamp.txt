Syncing

   @todo

Todo

     * In Basecamp, todo items that are unassigned should be thought of as
       bullet points. You can use for facts or links, but not action items
       These will be downloaded as markdown bullet points.

  Persons (@p flag)

     * When trying to match to a Basecamp person, the project only is
       searched.
     * Include either the first name, first plus inital (with or without
       period), or first and last.
     * The first matched item will be considered a match, so if you have
       two Gregs, you have to use the last initial or full last name.

Feature

     * The Taskcamp Feature summary = Basecamp Todo list description
