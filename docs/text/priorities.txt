    Priorities Relationship

Definition

   A list of Projects, Features and/or Todos (they do not have to be from
   the same project or client), each independently deployable with
   milestone and weight tags (among others). The purpose of the list is to
   indicate the following information:
     * What items are most important (@w)?
     * In what order should items be built?
     * What items must deploy simultaneously?
     * When will a given feature be deployed (@m)?

Conventions

   Furthermore, observe the following conventions:
     * If items must deploy simultaneously, then group them as a comma
       separated list, but enter as a single todo item. In the example
       below, this can be seen in the line beginning: Shopping Cart Flow,
       Eduction...
     * Priorities should be the top-most todo list in Basecamp.
     * Each item should contain an @w take so the priority is obvious;
       this takes precendence over the sort order in Basecamp.
