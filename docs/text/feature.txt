Overview

   A Feature is a block of markdown text that is parsed to extract the
   following types of information:
     * Title
     * Description
     * Todos (as a Priority List)
     * Questions
     * URLS
     * Files

  Title

   The first markdown h1 e.g. # My title on the page.

  Flags

   Flags should be appended to the title. See
   Features::getAvailableTags().

  Description

   The description is the first markdown paragraph to follow the title. It
   should follow this pattern:
    1. '# some title'
    2. blank line
    3. series of one or more lines = description
    4. blank line
    5. rest of document

   Example 1:
# Title @w-10 @pAaron

This
is
the
description.

but this is not.

   Example 2:
Some line of text

## Not the title

Some
paragraph
of
text not the description

# This is the Title @w-10 @pAaron

- [ ] this todo gets skipped over

This
is
the
description since it's first paragraph after title.

# This H1 is not, it comes second

and this is just a paragraph.

   Please note that paragraphs that are questions, or which start with
   http are not allowed as descriptions.

  Todos

   All todo items will be copied into and are available as a Priority List
   whose title and description inherit those of the Feature. See also
   [1]Todos, [2]Priorities.

  Questions

   Questions are paragraphs which start with a '?'
? This is a question.

  URLS

   Any string of text that begins with http:// through to the first
   whitespace. All URLS are available as a unique array, in the order they
   appear in the text.

  Files

   A list of file paths preceeded by a header of Files, e.g.
## Files
/some/great/path/index.html
/some/great/path/import.php
