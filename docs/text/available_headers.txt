Dates, times and intervals

   For dates you must use one of the following formats:
YYYY-MM-DD
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM+0000
HH:MM+0000

   Times always require the [1]Time offset from UTC.

   And you can also use [2]Time Intervals for some flags.
P1M
P7D

   For example here are a couple of todo items that are both due in 1
   week.
- [ ] This needs to be done in 1 week @fP1W
- [ ] This needs to be done in 1 week @fP7D
