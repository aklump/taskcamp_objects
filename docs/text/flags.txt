                                     Flags

   Flags give meta information about the object including the estimate
   time to complete, who it's assigned to and when it was finished, to
   name a few.
    1. You can escape a non flag like this \@d, using the backslash.
    2. All flags must be preceded with at least one char of whitespace,
       e.g. this@s14:54 will not be considered an @s flag.
    3. Multiple flags should be separated by a single space.
    4. By convention, flags should come at the end of the line, not in the
       middle.
    5. Flag values with a space should be wrapped in double quotes, e.g.
       @qb"In the Loft Studios"
    6. Flag values cannot contain double quotes.
