   The inspiration for this markup comes from [1]Markdown and [2]Github
   flavored markdown.

Format

    1. A todo is a single line of text (no line breaks).
    2. It begins with - [ ]; however see the note below about sloppy
       format.
    3. Various time flags are based on the [3]DateTime format.
    4. See also [4]github.com.

  Sloppy Format

   All of the following are shorthand methods that expand on compile...
- a todo item
-[]a todo item
-[ ]a todo item
- []a todo item

   ...to become...
- [ ] a todo item

   All of these completed todos...
-[x]a todo item
-[x ]a todo item
-[X]a todo item
-[X ]a todo item
- [x]a todo item
- [x ]a todo item
- [X]a todo item
- [X ]a todo item

   ...become...
- [x] a todo item

  Completed Status

   The completed status is shown by the presence or absence of an x in the
   todo prefix.

   This item is pending
- [ ] A pending item

   This item is complete
- [x] A complete item

  Completed Items

   Completed items will have 1000 added to their weight flag value to move
   them to the bottom of lists.
